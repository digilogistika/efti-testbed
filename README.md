## Introduction
This is eFTI testbed - a playground for eFTI project member states.
This is a place for testing implementations of eFTI gate, platform and authority systems.

The eFTI TestBed is available here: [https://eu-ee32.eftisandbox.eu/](https://eu-ee32.eftisandbox.eu/)

## Onboarding
Contact [support@dlk.ee](mailto:support@dlk.ee) to get your gate/platform/authority registered in the TestBed.

After you have contacted with the [support mail](mailto:support@dlk.ee) that you want to connect with the TestBed, you will receive credentials for a user that can access the Admin Panel.
From there you can see exactly the state of your current integration.

This just a helpful tool for understanding what is going inside the TestBed.
